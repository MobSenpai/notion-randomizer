# Notion randomizer

> Vision: I've always struggled to make a notion database pick a random page everyday. It has many applications like quotes, flashcards. But for me it was vocabulary, which is very important and thus as the saying goes _"Necessity is the mother of invention"_ , I also made this workflow.

## Notion locally

[X] fill the .env file

[X] database id will be in the link which you see in the url

[X] for randomizer key, make an integration and paste the secret key there

```
npm init
npm install @notionhq/client --save
npm install dotenv --save-dev

npm run notion.js
```

## Notion with pipedream (recommended)

[X] click [here](https://pipedream.com/new?h=tch_m1Afrn) to use this workflow

[X] just connect notion account to pipedream give access to required pages

[X] choose the database to work upon

[X] set the time

[X] Deploy the workflow, and Done!
